# Messages

While [formatters](/docs/formatters.md) are crucial to contextualizing alerts, it doesn't matter much if the alerts are never sent. This is where messages come in to play.

``nagios-herald`` provides a base Message class (``Message::Base``) from which all Message subclasses inherit.  ``Message::Base`` knows that all messages have content and recipients; it's the job of the Message subclasses to define additional behavior (such as how to send a message).

Three message types are defined in ``nagios-herald``: Email, Pager, and IRC.  Feel free to cook up any new message types (i.e. CarrierPigeon, SmokeSignal) as you see fit.

## Getting Content into Messages

Content generated by formatters is assigned to a message in ``Executor`` via the following code:

```ruby
formatter.generate_message_content
message.content = formatter.content
```
